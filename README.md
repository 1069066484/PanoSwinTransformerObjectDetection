# Implementation of PanoSwin Transformer
# Code for CVPR23 submission "PanoSwin: a Pano-style Swin Transformer for Panorama Understanding"
 *The code is based on https://github.com/SwinTransformer/Swin-Transformer-Object-Detection. This repo is still a mess. We will soon make it clean and clear.*
 
 But you can check mmdet/models/backbones/simple_panoswin_transformer.py for the main code.
